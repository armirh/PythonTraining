#function = a block of code which is executed only when it is called

#to start a function we use def in front
def hello(name,lastname,age): #add parameter inside, as much as we need
    print("Hello " + name + lastname)
    print("I am " + str(age) + " years old")

#every parameter has to be matched, so string with string and int with int in this example
hello("Armir"," Halimi",24) #calling the function and adding value to the parameter, we send arguments
#passing values means passing arguments
